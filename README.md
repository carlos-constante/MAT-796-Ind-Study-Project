One way to understand how the NYC Payroll Data Fiscal Year works is by looking at who it employs and how its employees are compensated. This data contains the names, job titles, and compensation for Citiwide Payroll on an annual basis from 2018 to 2020.

The original source for this data can be found on NYC OpenData. The data had been filtered by the "year" 2018, 2019, 2020; and "Leave Status as of June 30" Active, which is used for this project can be found on Kaggle.
